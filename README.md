# C++ Interface Library Template

This repository provides a basic template for creating a C++ interface library using CMake.

## Overview

This template sets up a simple C++ interface library that defines common settings, include directories, and dependencies, which can be propagated to other targets (e.g., executables or libraries) that use this interface.

## Features

- Template for creating a C++ interface library.
- CMake-based build system for managing and configuring the library.
- Includes placeholder directories for headers and source files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- CMake (version 3.20 or higher)
- C++ compiler supporting the required C++ standards
